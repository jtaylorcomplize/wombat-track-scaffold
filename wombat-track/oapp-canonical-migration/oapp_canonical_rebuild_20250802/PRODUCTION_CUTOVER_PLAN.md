# oApp Production Cutover Plan
**Governance Anchor**: `oapp-canonical-schema-rebuild-20250802`  
**Date**: 2025-08-02  
**Migration**: Canonical Hierarchy Rebuild (18 Projects / 38 Phases)

---

## üéØ Cutover Overview

### Objective
Promote validated canonical hierarchy from staging to production with zero data loss and minimal downtime.

### Scope
- **In Scope**: projects_canonical, phases_canonical, steps_canonical
- **Protected**: governance_logs, comms_canonical (remain untouched)
- **Impact**: oApp backend data alignment with Notion source

### Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level**: üü° Medium
- **Downtime**: < 5 minutes (database migration only)
- **Rollback Time**: < 2 minutes (restore from backup)
- **Data Loss Risk**: Minimal (governance preserved, canonical rebuilt)

## üóìÔ∏è Pre-Cutover Checklist

### üìã Staging Validation (Required)
- [ ] **Final Validation Pass**: Execute `04_validate_canonical_hierarchy.py`
  - [ ] ‚úÖ Exactly 18 projects imported
  - [ ] ‚úÖ Exactly 38 phases imported  
  - [ ] ‚úÖ Zero orphaned phases
  - [ ] ‚úÖ Zero orphaned steps
  - [ ] ‚úÖ Data quality checks pass
  - [ ] ‚úÖ No duplicate primary keys

### üîß Technical Preparation
- [ ] **Production Database Backup**: Full backup of oapp_production.db
- [ ] **Script Validation**: Test all scripts on staging replica
- [ ] **File Preparation**: Verify Notion CSV files are current
- [ ] **Environment Check**: Confirm production database accessibility
- [ ] **Service Dependencies**: Identify services requiring restart

### üìä Business Preparation
- [ ] **Stakeholder Notification**: Inform users of maintenance window
- [ ] **Change Window**: Schedule approved downtime (if required)
- [ ] **Rollback Authorization**: Confirm rollback decision authority
- [ ] **Go/No-Go Decision**: Final approval from system owner

## üöÄ Cutover Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Pre-Migration (5 minutes)
```bash
# 1.1 Create production backup
BACKUP_TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
cp oapp_production.db "oapp_production_backup_${BACKUP_TIMESTAMP}.db"

# 1.2 Verify backup integrity
sqlite3 "oapp_production_backup_${BACKUP_TIMESTAMP}.db" "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projects_canonical;"

# 1.3 Final staging validation
cd oapp_canonical_rebuild_20250802
python3 04_validate_canonical_hierarchy.py

# 1.4 Log cutover start
echo "$(date): Starting oApp canonical cutover - anchor: oapp-canonical-schema-rebuild-20250802" >> /var/log/oapp_cutover.log
```

### Phase 2: Schema Migration (3 minutes)
```bash
# 2.1 Update production database path in scripts
sed -i 's/oapp_staging.db/oapp_production.db/g' *.py *.sql

# 2.2 Execute truncation (with production backup verified)
sqlite3 oapp_production.db < 01_truncate_hierarchy.sql

# 2.3 Import canonical data
python3 02_import_canonical_data.py

# 2.4 Extract steps
python3 03_extract_steps_advanced.py
```

### Phase 3: Validation & Verification (2 minutes)
```bash
# 3.1 Production validation
python3 04_validate_canonical_hierarchy.py

# 3.2 Verify governance tables untouched
sqlite3 oapp_production.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM governance_logs; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comms_canonical;"

# 3.3 Quick smoke test
sqlite3 oapp_production.db "SELECT projectId, projectName FROM projects_canonical LIMIT 5;"
```

### Phase 4: Service Recovery (2 minutes)
```bash
# 4.1 Restart dependent services
sudo systemctl restart oapp-backend-service
sudo systemctl restart oapp-api-gateway

# 4.2 Verify service health
curl -f http://localhost:8080/api/health
curl -f http://localhost:8080/api/projects/count

# 4.3 Update MemoryPlugin anchor
echo "oapp-canonical-schema-rebuild-20250802-PRODUCTION" > /var/lib/oapp/memory_anchor.txt
```

---

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (< 2 minutes)
If validation fails or critical errors occur:

```bash
# Emergency rollback procedure
BACKUP_FILE=$(ls -t oapp_production_backup_*.db | head -1)
cp "$BACKUP_FILE" oapp_production.db

# Restart services
sudo systemctl restart oapp-backend-service
sudo systemctl restart oapp-api-gateway

# Verify rollback
sqlite3 oapp_production.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projects_canonical;"

# Log rollback
echo "$(date): ROLLBACK EXECUTED - restored from $BACKUP_FILE" >> /var/log/oapp_cutover.log
```

### Rollback Decision Criteria
Execute rollback if ANY of these occur:
- Production validation script fails
- Row counts don't match expected (18/38)
- Orphaned records detected in production
- Service health checks fail after restart
- API endpoints return errors
- System owner requests abort

---

## üìä Post-Cutover Verification

### Immediate Checks (5 minutes)
```bash
# Data integrity verification
sqlite3 oapp_production.db << EOF
.headers on
.mode column
SELECT 'Projects' as type, COUNT(*) as count FROM projects_canonical
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Phases' as type, COUNT(*) as count FROM phases_canonical  
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Steps' as type, COUNT(*) as count FROM steps_canonical
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Governance' as type, COUNT(*) as count FROM governance_logs;
EOF

# API health verification
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/projects | jq '.length'
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/phases | jq '.length'
```

### Extended Monitoring (30 minutes)
- [ ] **API Response Times**: Monitor for performance degradation
- [ ] **Error Logs**: Check for database-related errors
- [ ] **User Acceptance**: Verify UI shows correct project/phase data
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Run automated test suite
- [ ] **Business Logic**: Verify project-phase relationships work correctly

## üìã Governance & Documentation

### MemoryPlugin Integration
```bash
# Update memory anchor for permanent reference
echo "Production cutover completed: $(date)" >> /var/lib/oapp/governance.log
echo "Anchor: oapp-canonical-schema-rebuild-20250802-PRODUCTION" >> /var/lib/oapp/governance.log
echo "Projects: 18, Phases: 38, Status: ACTIVE" >> /var/lib/oapp/governance.log
```

### Archive Management
```bash
# Archive cutover artifacts
mkdir -p DriveMemory/QA/Canonical_Rebuild/20250802/production_cutover
cp oapp_canonical_rebuild_20250802/* DriveMemory/QA/Canonical_Rebuild/20250802/production_cutover/
cp /var/log/oapp_cutover.log DriveMemory/QA/Canonical_Rebuild/20250802/production_cutover/
cp oapp_production_backup_*.db DriveMemory/QA/Canonical_Rebuild/20250802/production_cutover/
