- **Versioning:** Timestamped snapshots with semantic versioning where applicable

## Agent Integration
- **Memory Anchor Service:** References canonical data models and snapshots
- **DriveMemory Sync:** Automated ingestion of classified exports and backups
- **Data Validation Agent:** Integrity checks and export validation
