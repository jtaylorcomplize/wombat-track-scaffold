Design Principles,WT-UX12,Completed,"Purpose:
Wombat Track (WT) is an intelligent, AI-augmented platform for planning, executing, and governing complex multi-phase projects. It integrates SDLC principles, real-time progress tracking, rich documentation, and Claude/Gizmo agentic workflows. The platform must empower teams to work transparently, efficiently, and with traceable automation from planning to deployment.","🧠 Core Design Principle: ""Form Follows Governance""
Wombat Track is not just a productivity tool — it's a governance operating system. Therefore:
• Structure and hierarchy are non-negotiable: All projects must follow a Phase → Step → Log structure.
• Traceability is primary UX: Every action (AI prompt, export, phase update) must be logged, visible, and auditable.
• Planning and execution coexist: Wireframes must allow both tactical (Composer, Docs) and operational (Dashboard) views.
🎨 UI/UX Pillars (Mapped from Figma’s Principles)PrincipleApplication in WTHierarchySidebar for project scope → Tabs for function → Cards for content. Always show user where they are and what level of detail they’re seeing.ClarityUse emoji + label combos (e.g., 🟡 Amber) for RAG, short labels, summary text before actions.ConsistencyTabs, cards, headers, filters, and AI buttons use shared design language (rounded corners, small caps, muted foregrounds).EfficiencyOne-click prompts (⚡ Scaffold), inline edits, and context-aware AI actions reduce user effort.ForgivenessAutosave Docs, confirmation modals for dangerous actions, clear status indicators (e.g., “Saving…”).ContextMetadata on every object — a Step knows its Phase, a Doc knows its Project, an AI edit logs its source.Progressive DisclosurePhase collapses to Step list; Composer expands only rows needed; Docs open AI modal when requested.
🔧 Organisational Structure
The app is structured across 3 main tabs, all sharing a project context:
1. 📊 Dashboard Tab (Execution Surface)
    ◦ Visualise current project Phase/Step status.
    ◦ See RAG status, step checklists, blockers, and what’s complete.
    ◦ Embed Governance Logs (future).
2. 🧱 Composer Tab (Planning Surface)
    ◦ Feature matrix: breakdown, RAG, owners, AI tooling.
    ◦ Connects to Phase generation and Docs.
    ◦ Serves as a hybrid backlog / roadmap / planning surface.
3. 📘 Docs Tab (Knowledge Surface)
    ◦ Create/edit documents linked to projects and phases.
    ◦ Metadata: docType, tags, related items.
    ◦ Launch AI modal (Scaffold SOP, Revise, Summarise).
    ◦ Export to Markdown / Drive / MemoryPlugin (future native RAG Memory).",,,,"🚀 Forward Guidance
• PhasePlan should link directly to Docs + Composer: Each Phase gets its own Overview Doc; Steps auto-generate Docs/Logs.
• Governance should be visible, not buried: Add Governance Log tab or modal.
• Introduce modular “widgets” for status cards, RAG, AI buttons to allow reuse in all tabs.
• Filter/Sort across all views by RAG, project, owner, etc.","Orbis Design (https://www.notion.so/Orbis-Design-23ee1901e36e8008bceee535caef4acd?pvs=21), Logo Vision (https://www.notion.so/Logo-Vision-23ee1901e36e8039958bcd093f11944d?pvs=21), Logo and Brand visual identity (https://www.notion.so/Logo-and-Brand-visual-identity-23ee1901e36e808995abd2389e83375c?pvs=21), Wireframes (https://www.notion.so/Wireframes-23ee1901e36e804abc44e05bb8bba397?pvs=21)",,,,,,,"July 28, 2025 10:32 AM","July 29, 2025 2:41 PM",Jackson

"Infrastructure, CI/CD",WT-UX16,Completed,"The purpose of Phase 3.x is to establish robust developer infrastructure, CI/CD automation, and governance-enforced quality controls across the Wombat Track platform.
🧭 Purpose
This Phase 3.x plan focuses on improving the internal tooling and delivery pipeline of the Wombat Track (WT) system. It consolidates infrastructure, formalises testing and deployment workflows, introduces meta-level error detection, and prepares the WT app for scale by improving developer reliability, clarity, and governance.
This phase supports both:
• WombatConsole (Execution Layer)
• MetaPlatform (Governance Layer)
🛠️ Goals
1. Establish full pre-deployment test infrastructure.
2. Create a WT MetaValidator for governance and code review enforcement.
3. Migrate and formalise existing CI/CD steps into tracked, actionable phases.
4. Ensure all failures in dev/deploy workflows trigger structured diagnostics and task creation.","This document summarizes the implementation and governance outcomes of WT Phase 3.x, covering Phases WT-3.0 to WT-3.3. 
📎 Completed Supporting Actions
• ✅ Schema enhancements: phaseType, phaseOwner, ragStatus fields added
• ✅ PhaseMetadataModal created with edit/save/governance-log support
• ✅ GovernanceLog API wired to UI metadata edits
• ✅ Filtering and badges added to PhasePlanDashboard
• ✅ WT-3.1 to WT-3.3 added to seedPhaseTracker.ts

🧠 Governance Note
Phase 3.x marks the first successful loop of planning → implementation → metadata capture → governance logging within the WT system. This model now serves as a baseline template for future Project → Phase → Step plans, including auto-generation and AI agent interaction.",,,,"🧠 Development Philosophy
• Governance-aware SDLC: Treat the WT console as a self-documenting, auditable platform
• Developer UX: Surface test failures and RAG state in human-readable formats
• Meta-awareness: Allow the system to reflect on its own health
🧩 Governance Structure
• Each project must:

    ◦ Include markdown-based phase plan
    ◦ Use validated project > phase > step structure
    ◦ Be tagged with WT type, owner, and color
    ◦ Have minimum 1 phase and 2 steps

🔍 Next Steps – Requirements Questions for WT-3.3 and Beyond
❓ WT-3.3 – MetaValidator
1. Scope: Should the validator scan only code, or also project/phase markdown?
2. Failure Handling: Do you want it to create task records (or execution logs) on error?
3. Blocking: Should it block commits/deploys or warn only?
❓ WT-3.4 – Guided Project Template
1. Should new projects auto-fill with the full phase markdown (like this doc)?
2. Should there be a modal UI or full-page wizard for creation?
3. Do we allow choosing template type (e.g. PlatformOps, Console, Product)?
❓ WT-3.5 – Guided Phase Creation
1. When creating a new Phase, what questions must be asked?
2. Should side quests be encouraged at this point?
3. What metadata must be defined before allowing step creation?
❓ WT-3.6+ – MetaReflections Engine
1. Should recurring failures auto-generate ""Reflections"" (e.g. Phase failed X times)?
2. Do we want analytics around phase health (completion rates, RAG trends)?
3. Should Reflections generate suggested planning comments for future phases?
📦 Ready for Template Packaging
This document format can now be used to create:
• Project-level markdown on creation
• Phase summary initialiser
• Planning dashboard views (read-only or editable)

Post-mortem - sidebar rendering failure,WT-UX11,Completed,"❌ Incident Summary
Despite multiple implementation attempts, the ProjectSidebar component in the /phase-plan view rendered with layout and nesting failures. Interactive elements functioned, but the visual alignment, spacing, and hierarchy were broken.","🧠 Root Cause Analysis
• Snapshot Tests False Positive: Puppeteer baseline captured broken layout.
• Inconsistent Tailwind Usage: flex, items-center, pl-* spacing improperly applied.
• Disclosure Nesting Not Componentised: No reusable SidebarItem abstraction.
• Lack of Dynamic DOM Visual Diffing: Puppeteer not sufficient for nuanced visual QA.
• Prompt/Dev Drift: Code complexity diverged from original SDLC simplicity goals.
✅ What Worked
• CI build pipeline, tsc checks, and snapshot tests were executed.
• GovernanceLog tracked initial failures.
• Copilot-generated fallback layout provided a working, clean design.

WT SubApp Developmetn,WT-UX4,Completed,"✅ Summary
This artefact confirms strategic direction across Roam and Complize regarding AI architecture, integration, and product rebuild decisions.",,,,Strategy,"1. Should we generate a single centralised framework to run all AI Apps across Roam & Complize?
Answer: ✅ Yes — Build a meta-layer infrastructure that is app-agnostic and reusable.
Rationale:
• Wombat Track already serves as a governance and orchestration layer.
• MetaPlatform provides AI runtime execution with CI/CD, prompt dispatch, and agentic logic.
• Reusability across apps avoids duplication and enables faster scaling.
• Promotes semantic governance, consistent RAG/risk tracking, and agent orchestration.
📌 Conclusion: Build once → reuse across Roam, Complize, and future apps.
2. Should we build an integration layer to harmonise workflows (Gmail, Actionstep, Notion, etc)?
Answer: ⚠️ Yes — but selectively and semantically.
Rationale:
• Don’t replicate Zapier. Instead, ingest external tool data into Wombat Track.
• Use lightweight sync agents to bring in:

    ◦ Notion governance metadata
    ◦ Gmail meeting summaries
    ◦ Actionstep decision records
• Feed structured logs into MemoryPlugin, GovernanceLog, DriveMemory.
📌 Conclusion: Harmonise workflows via AI-aware ingestion + governance, not monolithic merging.
3. Should we rebuild Complize as a modular app with sub-apps (e.g. Knowledge, Visa Bytes, Case Management)?
Answer: 🟢 Yes — Complize should be rebuilt as a modular app on shared AI infrastructure.
Rationale:
• Matches Complize’s vision as an ""Immigration OS""
• Enables Workforce, Nexus, Verify to be launched independently or combined
• Centralises audit, AI assistance, and lifecycle data via shared layer
📌 Conclusion: New Complize app will run on top of the MetaPlatform/Wombat core with sub-apps modularised.
