# Git Hygiene QA Checklist for Gizmo

## URGENT: Extensive Changes Made Without Proper Git Protocol

### Current Situation Assessment

**Branch**: `main` (DANGER: Working directly on main!)
**Changes**: 6 modified files + 17 new untracked files
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Extensive UI/UX implementation without proper branching

### Modified Files That Need QA Review

#### Core System Files (HIGH RISK)
1. **`src/index.css`** - Complete design system overhaul with CSS custom properties
2. **`src/types/phase.ts`** - Type definition changes affecting multiple components
3. **`src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx`** - Main layout component with new work surfaces architecture

#### Component Modifications (MEDIUM RISK)
4. **`src/components/layout/BreadcrumbHeader.tsx`** - Navigation enhancement with new surface styles
5. **`src/components/surfaces/PlanSurface.tsx`** - Enhanced with smart suggestions and progress components
6. **`src/components/common/StatusCard.tsx`** - Updated to use new design system

### New Files That Need Review

#### New UI Components (Need Standards Review)
- `src/components/common/EmptyState.tsx`
- `src/components/common/HelpTooltip.tsx` 
- `src/components/common/LoadingSpinner.tsx`
- `src/components/common/ProgressBar.tsx`
- `src/components/common/SmartSuggestion.tsx`

#### Documentation & Scripts (Low Risk)
- `TECHNICAL_DESIGN_PROPOSAL.md`
- Various scripts in `/scripts/` directory
- UML diagrams and temp files

## IMMEDIATE QA ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. Code Quality Assessment

**Lint Check:**
```bash
npm run lint
# Expected: 113 errors (mostly in legacy code, not our changes)
```

**TypeScript Compilation:**
```bash
npm run build
# Status: ‚úÖ PASSING (538KB bundle)
```

**Test Suite:**
```bash
npm run test
# Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è UNKNOWN - Needs verification
```

### 2. File-by-File Review Checklist

#### `src/index.css` - Design System
- [ ] Verify CSS custom properties don't conflict with Tailwind
- [ ] Check responsive design breakpoints are sensible
- [ ] Ensure animation performance is acceptable
- [ ] Validate accessibility features (focus states, reduced motion)

#### `src/types/phase.ts` - Type Definitions  
- [ ] Confirm added properties (`status`, `completionPercentage`, `currentPhase`) don't break existing code
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility with `/types/models.ts`
- [ ] Check all enum values are consistent across codebase

#### `src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx` - Main Layout
- [ ] Verify mock data matches new type definitions
- [ ] Check sidebar collapse/expand functionality
- [ ] Test work surface navigation
- [ ] Ensure responsive behavior works

#### New Components
- [ ] Code follows project conventions (imports, exports, props)
- [ ] TypeScript types are properly defined
- [ ] Components are accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use design tokens)

### 3. Functional Testing Requirements

#### Critical User Flows
- [ ] Project selection and switching
- [ ] Work surface navigation (Plan ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Document ‚Üí Govern ‚Üí Integrate)
- [ ] Sidebar collapse/expand
- [ ] Progress bar animations
- [ ] Smart suggestions display logic
- [ ] Status card interactions

#### Cross-Browser Testing
- [ ] Chrome (primary)
- [ ] Firefox 
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Edge

#### Responsive Testing
- [ ] Mobile (< 640px)
- [ ] Tablet (640px - 1024px)  
- [ ] Desktop (> 1024px)

### 4. Performance Impact Assessment

#### Bundle Size Analysis
- Current: 538KB (warning threshold exceeded)
- [ ] Identify largest imports in new components
- [ ] Consider code splitting for new features
- [ ] Optimize CSS if bundle size is concerning

#### Runtime Performance
- [ ] Check for memory leaks in animations
- [ ] Verify smooth 60fps animations
- [ ] Test with large project datasets

### 5. Security Review

#### New Components
- [ ] No XSS vulnerabilities in dynamic content
- [ ] Proper input sanitization in tooltips/suggestions
- [ ] No sensitive data in console logs

#### Type Safety
- [ ] All props properly typed
- [ ] No `any` types in new components
- [ ] Proper error boundaries

## RECOMMENDED GIT HYGIENE RECOVERY PLAN

### Option A: Create Feature Branch (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# Create feature branch from current state
git checkout -b feature/ux-design-system-implementation

# Stage and commit changes
git add [reviewed files]
git commit -m "feat: implement comprehensive UX design system

- Add modern design system with CSS custom properties
- Implement work surfaces architecture  
- Add contextual UI components (tooltips, progress bars, smart suggestions)
- Enhance responsive design patterns
- Update type definitions for improved component compatibility

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/ux-design-system-implementation
```

### Option B: Stash and Review (SAFER)
```bash
# Stash all changes for review
git stash push -m "UX design system implementation - needs review"

# Review changes individually
git stash show -p

# Apply back after QA approval
git stash pop
```

## FILES TO EXCLUDE FROM COMMIT

### Temporary/Development Files
- `.env.swp`
- `notion-export-*.json` 
- `wombat-track-export.zip` (already deleted)

### Review Before Including
- All files in `/scripts/` directory
- UML diagram files
- `.claude/` directory

## ROLLBACK PLAN

If issues are discovered:

1. **Immediate Rollback:**
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD -- [problematic-file]
   ```

2. **Full Rollback:**
   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD
   ```

3. **Selective Rollback:**
   ```bash
   git restore src/index.css  # Just the design system
   git restore src/types/phase.ts  # Just the types
   ```

## TESTING STRATEGY

### Automated Testing
1. Run existing test suite: `npm run test`
2. Check TypeScript: `npm run build`
3. Lint code: `npm run lint`

### Manual Testing Priority
1. **Critical Path**: Project loading ‚Üí Surface navigation ‚Üí Core functionality
2. **New Features**: Smart suggestions, progress bars, tooltips
3. **Responsive**: Mobile navigation and interactions
4. **Performance**: Animation smoothness, loading times

## SIGN-OFF CHECKLIST

- [ ] All modified files reviewed and approved
- [ ] New components meet coding standards
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] Test suite passes
- [ ] Performance impact acceptable
- [ ] Security review complete
- [ ] Proper branch created
- [ ] Commit message follows conventions
- [ ] PR created with proper description

## Summary for Gizmo

We implemented a comprehensive UX design system without proper Git branching. The changes are extensive but appear to be working (build passes, dev server runs). However, we need proper QA review before committing to ensure we haven't broken anything or introduced security issues.

**Immediate Action Required**: Create feature branch and run full QA process before any commits to main.
