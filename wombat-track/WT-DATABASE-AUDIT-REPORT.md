## Recommendations
### Immediate Actions
1. **Canonical Set Adoption**: Focus development efforts on the top 20-30 projects (score ‚â•60)
2. **Orphan Resolution**: Link orphaned phases to correct projects or archive if obsolete
3. **Duplicate Consolidation**: Review potential duplicates and merge or differentiate as appropriate
4. **Archive Review**: Evaluate low-scoring projects for archival to reduce maintenance overhead

### Data Quality Improvements
1. **Standardize Project IDs**: Migrate RECON-* projects to WT-* format or archive
2. **Assign Ownership**: Ensure all active projects have clear owners
3. **Enhance Governance**: Implement consistent governance logging for all active projects
4. **Phase Structure**: Establish phase definitions for projects lacking execution structure
