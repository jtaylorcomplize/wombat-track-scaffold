# Nested Dashboard Routing Fix - Phase 4.0

## Summary
Fixed nested dashboard rendering failures in Orbis Platform Phase 4.0 (Admin Embedded) by implementing React Router and restoring proper component hierarchy.

## Date
2025-08-02

## Issue
- Nested dashboards (Project → Phase → Step) were not rendering
- Sub-App dashboards showed blank content
- Routes like `/projects/:id/phases/:phaseId` and `/subapps/:id` loaded empty
- 13 console errors reported during Sub-App QA (Phase 5)

## Root Cause
The Phase 4.0 Admin re-embed and sidebar refactor removed React Router infrastructure, causing the application to use state-based navigation without proper nested route support.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Installed React Router
```bash
npm install react-router-dom@7.7.1
```

### 2. Created Missing Components
- `src/components/projects/PhaseDashboard.tsx` - Phase detail view with Outlet
- `src/components/projects/StepDashboard.tsx` - Step detail view
- `src/components/subapps/SubAppMainDashboard.tsx` - Sub-app main dashboard
- `src/components/subapps/SubAppAnalyticsDashboard.tsx` - Sub-app analytics view

### 3. Implemented Routing Structure
Created `src/router/AppRouter.tsx` with proper nested routing:
```
/projects/:projectId/phases/:phaseId
/projects/:projectId/phases/:phaseId/steps/:stepId
/subapps/:subAppId/dashboard
/subapps/:subAppId/analytics
```

### 4. Added React Router Outlets
- Updated `ProjectDashboard.tsx` to include `<Outlet />` for nested routes
- Updated `SubAppDashboard.tsx` to include `<Outlet />` for sub-app views
- Added navigation hooks (`useNavigate`, `useParams`) for route handling

### 5. Implemented Lazy Loading
All nested dashboards use React.lazy() with console logging for QA tracking.

### 6. Created Puppeteer Tests
`puppeteer-tests/nested-dashboard.spec.js` validates:
- Phase dashboard rendering
- Step dashboard rendering
- Sub-app dashboard rendering
- Navigation between nested routes
- Screenshots saved to `/qa-artifacts/nested-dashboards/`

## Files Modified
1. `src/App.tsx` - Added router support
2. `src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx` - Maintained existing layout
3. `src/components/ProjectDashboard.tsx` - Added Outlet and routing
4. `src/components/SubAppDashboard.tsx` - Added Outlet and navigation
5. `src/router/AppRouter.tsx` - New routing configuration
6. `package.json` - Added react-router-dom dependency

## Governance Entry
```json
{
  "event_type": "nested_dashboards_fixed",
  "resource_id": "of-admin-4.0-nested-dash-fixed-20250802",
  "phase": "Phase 4.0 Admin Embedded",
  "fix_type": "nested_routing_restoration"
}
```

## Testing
Run Puppeteer test:
```bash
npm run test:nested-dashboards
# or
jest puppeteer-tests/nested-dashboard.spec.js
```

## Next Steps
1. Run the Puppeteer test suite to validate all nested routes
2. Check browser console for lazy loading messages
3. Verify context providers are working correctly
4. Test navigation between all nested levels
