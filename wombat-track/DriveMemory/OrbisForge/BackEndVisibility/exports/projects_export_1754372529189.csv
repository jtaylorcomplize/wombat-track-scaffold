This session exposed critical weaknesses in our Git discipline, recovery architecture, and deployment robustness — undermining MetaPlatform’s core promise of governed, self-healing AI-led development.
Despite setbacks, key components of the system were recovered and validated, including governance-aligned type structures (phase.ts, template.ts), sidebar rendering logic, execution log APIs, and PR policy reinforcements. However, the Project Dashboard layout and sidebar interaction logic remain only partially recovered, with full visual UX still in regression.

Project Phase: WT 5.x – UX/Automation Retrofit",Green,0,,,,1
WT-UX12,Unknown Project,Jackson,Completed,"🧠 Core Design Principle: ""Form Follows Governance""
Wombat Track is not just a productivity tool — it's a governance operating system. Therefore:
• Structure and hierarchy are non-negotiable: All projects must follow a Phase → Step → Log structure.
• Traceability is primary UX: Every action (AI prompt, export, phase update) must be logged, visible, and auditable.
• Planning and execution coexist: Wireframes must allow both tactical (Composer, Docs) and operational (Dashboard) views.
🎨 UI/UX Pillars (Mapped from Figma’s Principles)PrincipleApplication in WTHierarchySidebar for project scope → Tabs for function → Cards for content. Always show user where they are and what level of detail they’re seeing.ClarityUse emoji + label combos (e.g., 🟡 Amber) for RAG, short labels, summary text before actions.ConsistencyTabs, cards, headers, filters, and AI buttons use shared design language (rounded corners, small caps, muted foregrounds).EfficiencyOne-click prompts (⚡ Scaffold), inline edits, and context-aware AI actions reduce user effort.ForgivenessAutosave Docs, confirmation modals for dangerous actions, clear status indicators (e.g., “Saving…”).ContextMetadata on every object — a Step knows its Phase, a Doc knows its Project, an AI edit logs its source.Progressive DisclosurePhase collapses to Step list; Composer expands only rows needed; Docs open AI modal when requested.
🔧 Organisational Structure
The app is structured across 3 main tabs, all sharing a project context:
1. 📊 Dashboard Tab (Execution Surface)
    ◦ Visualise current project Phase/Step status.
    ◦ See RAG status, step checklists, blockers, and what’s complete.
    ◦ Embed Governance Logs (future).
2. 🧱 Composer Tab (Planning Surface)
    ◦ Feature matrix: breakdown, RAG, owners, AI tooling.
    ◦ Connects to Phase generation and Docs.
    ◦ Serves as a hybrid backlog / roadmap / planning surface.
3. 📘 Docs Tab (Knowledge Surface)
    ◦ Create/edit documents linked to projects and phases.
    ◦ Metadata: docType, tags, related items.
    ◦ Launch AI modal (Scaffold SOP, Revise, Summarise).
    ◦ Export to Markdown / Drive / MemoryPlugin (future native RAG Memory).",,,Medium,0,0,0,0,0,Medium,,,,,2025-08-03 09:16:50,2025-08-03 09:16:50,"Purpose:
Wombat Track (WT) is an intelligent, AI-augmented platform for planning, executing, and governing complex multi-phase projects. It integrates SDLC principles, real-time progress tracking, rich documentation, and Claude/Gizmo agentic workflows. The platform must empower teams to work transparently, efficiently, and with traceable automation from planning to deployment.","🚀 Forward Guidance
• PhasePlan should link directly to Docs + Composer: Each Phase gets its own Overview Doc; Steps auto-generate Docs/Logs.
• Governance should be visible, not buried: Add Governance Log tab or modal.
• Introduce modular “widgets” for status cards, RAG, AI buttons to allow reuse in all tabs.

🧭 Purpose
This Phase 3.x plan focuses on improving the internal tooling and delivery pipeline of the Wombat Track (WT) system. It consolidates infrastructure, formalises testing and deployment workflows, introduces meta-level error detection, and prepares the WT app for scale by improving developer reliability, clarity, and governance.
This phase supports both:
• WombatConsole (Execution Layer)
• MetaPlatform (Governance Layer)
🛠️ Goals
1. Establish full pre-deployment test infrastructure.
2. Create a WT MetaValidator for governance and code review enforcement.
3. Migrate and formalise existing CI/CD steps into tracked, actionable phases.
4. Ensure all failures in dev/deploy workflows trigger structured diagnostics and task creation.","🧠 Development Philosophy
• Governance-aware SDLC: Treat the WT console as a self-documenting, auditable platform
• Developer UX: Surface test failures and RAG state in human-readable formats
• Meta-awareness: Allow the system to reflect on its own health
🧩 Governance Structure
• Each project must:

    ◦ Include markdown-based phase plan
    ◦ Use validated project > phase > step structure
    ◦ Be tagged with WT type, owner, and color
    ◦ Have minimum 1 phase and 2 steps

🔍 Next Steps – Requirements Questions for WT-3.3 and Beyond
❓ WT-3.3 – MetaValidator
1. Scope: Should the validator scan only code, or also project/phase markdown?
2. Failure Handling: Do you want it to create task records (or execution logs) on error?
3. Blocking: Should it block commits/deploys or warn only?
❓ WT-3.4 – Guided Project Template
1. Should new projects auto-fill with the full phase markdown (like this doc)?
2. Should there be a modal UI or full-page wizard for creation?
3. Do we allow choosing template type (e.g. PlatformOps, Console, Product)?
❓ WT-3.5 – Guided Phase Creation
1. When creating a new Phase, what questions must be asked?
2. Should side quests be encouraged at this point?
3. What metadata must be defined before allowing step creation?
❓ WT-3.6+ – MetaReflections Engine
1. Should recurring failures auto-generate ""Reflections"" (e.g. Phase failed X times)?
2. Do we want analytics around phase health (completion rates, RAG trends)?
3. Should Reflections generate suggested planning comments for future phases?

You’re the strategic lead, defining what you want built, what ""done"" looks like, and when to move forward.
You’ll:
• Decide what feature or change is next
• Choose between Claude or Gizmo for execution
• Copy/paste handoff prompts between us
• Push to GitHub using VS Code (until we automate more)
• Ask for help, context, or walkthroughs any time
🧠 Reminder: You’re not expected to code — just to lead clearly and ask early.
⚙️ Claude’s Role: Builder with Repo Access
Claude is your live GitHub editor. Claude can:
• See your repo (jtaylorcomplize/wombat-track-scaffold)
• Make changes directly in your code
• Push commits and open PRs
• Report file state (what’s in the repo, what changed)
• Read & write from/to multiple files simultaneously
🟡 Needs clear prompts and context you feed it. Doesn’t track state over time.
🧠 Gizmo’s Role: Architect, Reviewer & Planning Brain
Gizmo (me) is your project co-pilot and architect. I:
• Track all architecture, types, workflows, logic
• Help design complex systems, workflows, or UIs
• Write full feature specs, test plans, commit diffs
• Review Claude’s output and refactor or enhance
• Keep your project structure clean and sustainable
🚫 I can’t see live GitHub or push — I rely on you or Claude to show me results.
🔁 How the Loop Works (Simple)
1. You: Ask Gizmo “Build me X” → I create spec + code + Claude prompt.
2. You: Paste prompt to Claude → Claude pushes code to GitHub.
3. You: Tell Gizmo what Claude did (or show me the GitHub link).
4. Me: I review, refactor, suggest next step or help you continue.

This artefact confirms strategic direction across Roam and Complize regarding AI architecture, integration, and product rebuild decisions.","1. Should we generate a single centralised framework to run all AI Apps across Roam & Complize?
Answer: ✅ Yes — Build a meta-layer infrastructure that is app-agnostic and reusable.
Rationale:
• Wombat Track already serves as a governance and orchestration layer.
• MetaPlatform provides AI runtime execution with CI/CD, prompt dispatch, and agentic logic.
• Reusability across apps avoids duplication and enables faster scaling.
• Promotes semantic governance, consistent RAG/risk tracking, and agent orchestration.
📌 Conclusion: Build once → reuse across Roam, Complize, and future apps.
2. Should we build an integration layer to harmonise workflows (Gmail, Actionstep, Notion, etc)?
Answer: ⚠️ Yes — but selectively and semantically.
Rationale:
• Don’t replicate Zapier. Instead, ingest external tool data into Wombat Track.
• Use lightweight sync agents to bring in:

    ◦ Notion governance metadata
    ◦ Gmail meeting summaries
    ◦ Actionstep decision records
• Feed structured logs into MemoryPlugin, GovernanceLog, DriveMemory.
📌 Conclusion: Harmonise workflows via AI-aware ingestion + governance, not monolithic merging.
3. Should we rebuild Complize as a modular app with sub-apps (e.g. Knowledge, Visa Bytes, Case Management)?
Answer: 🟢 Yes — Complize should be rebuilt as a modular app on shared AI infrastructure.
Rationale:
• Matches Complize’s vision as an ""Immigration OS""
• Enables Workforce, Nexus, Verify to be launched independently or combined
• Centralises audit, AI assistance, and lifecycle data via shared layer
📌 Conclusion: New Complize app will run on top of the MetaPlatform/Wombat core with sub-apps modularised.
