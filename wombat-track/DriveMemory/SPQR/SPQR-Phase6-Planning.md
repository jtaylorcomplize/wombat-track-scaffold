- **Business Value:** Enhanced security, automated refresh, reduced manual intervention
- **Technical Scope:**
  - Replace Puppeteer Gmail automation with OAuth 2.0 flow
  - Implement service account authentication for Looker Studio API
  - Create secure token management and refresh mechanisms
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing embed URLs

#### 2. Integrate SPQR Dashboards into Orbis Dashboard Health Panel
- **Current State:** SPQR dashboards accessible via separate runtime page
- **Target State:** Native integration into Orbis Dashboard with health monitoring
- **Business Value:** Unified dashboard experience, real-time health monitoring
- **Technical Scope:**
  - Embed SPQR dashboard widgets into Orbis Dashboard health panel
  - Create unified health status indicators across all analytics
  - Implement cross-platform RAG scoring and alerting
  - Ensure seamless user experience across all dashboard components

#### 3. Enable Continuous Semantic Audit with MemoryPlugin + RAG
- **Current State:** Manual UAT and governance logging
- **Target State:** Automated semantic analysis and continuous audit capabilities
- **Business Value:** Proactive issue detection, automated quality assurance
- **Technical Scope:**
  - Integrate MemoryPlugin for continuous semantic analysis
  - Implement RAG-based audit workflows for dashboard content
  - Create automated anomaly detection for data quality
  - Enable predictive analytics for system health and performance

## 📋 Phase 5 Context & Foundation
