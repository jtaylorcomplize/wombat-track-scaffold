## üìã 2Ô∏è‚É£ Repository Management Rules

| Rule | Description | Enforcement | Violation Response |
|------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Branch Naming Convention** | `feature/{phase_step_id}-{short_desc}` | Automated validation | PR blocked until renamed |
| **Clean Branch Policy** | New branches always from updated main | Pre-commit hooks | Force sync with main required |
| **Branch Cleanup** | Auto-delete merged branches (local + remote) | GitHub Actions automation | Manual cleanup if automation fails |
| **One Feature = One Branch** | Never mix features; reduces regression risk | PR review validation | PR rejected if multiple features detected |
| **PR Governance Check** | PR requires Co-Pilot test + security pass + GovernanceLog JSONL | GitHub Actions workflow | PR blocked until all checks pass |

### Branch Naming Examples
```bash
# Correct Examples
feature/of-8.8.1-agent-initialization
feature/of-8.8.2-mcp-integration  
feature/of-8.9.1-ui-enhancement
hotfix/critical-security-patch-20250806

# Incorrect Examples (Will be rejected)
feature/multiple-changes
dev-branch
temp-fix
feature/of881agentinit
```

### Branch Lifecycle Management
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch from updated main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/of-8.8.1-agent-initialization

# 2. Development with regular commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat(of-8.8.1): implement agent initialization framework

- Add AgentInitializer class with lifecycle management
- Implement configuration validation and error handling
- Add comprehensive unit tests with 95% coverage
- Update governance documentation

Governance-Entry: OF-8.8.1-step-progress-update
Memory-Anchor: of-8.8.1-agent-init
"

# 3. Push to remote and create PR
git push origin feature/of-8.8.1-agent-initialization
```

        end
    else Validation fails
        GH->>Dev: PR blocked - fix validation issues
    end
```

#### PR Requirements Checklist
