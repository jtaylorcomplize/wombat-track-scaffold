## üéØ Migration Overview

### Objective
Clean rebuild of Projects, Phases, and Steps hierarchy to align with canonical Notion source while preserving governance and communication history.

### Scope
- **Migrated**: projects_canonical, phases_canonical, steps_canonical
- **Preserved**: governance_logs, comms_canonical
- **Source**: Notion CSV exports (18 projects, 38 phases)
