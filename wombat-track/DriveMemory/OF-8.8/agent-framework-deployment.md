## üìä Project Intelligence System

### Health Metrics
```typescript
ProjectIntelligence {
  health: {
    score: 0.85,           // Overall health score (0-1)
    trend: 'stable',       // 'improving' | 'stable' | 'declining'
    lastUpdated: timestamp
  },
  governance: {
    complianceScore: 0.90, // Compliance score (0-1)
    auditTrail: string[],  // Audit trail references
    memoryAnchors: string[], // Memory anchor validations
    missingLinks: string[]   // Missing governance links
  },
  technical: {
    codeQuality: 0.88,     // Code quality score (0-1)
    testCoverage: 0.75,    // Test coverage percentage
    performance: 0.82,     // Performance score (0-1)
    dependencies: {
      outdated: string[],  // Outdated dependencies
      vulnerable: string[] // Vulnerable dependencies
    }
  }
}
```
