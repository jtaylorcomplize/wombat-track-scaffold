CI/CD Test Execution Log - OF-9.2.2.4
======================================

Test Suite: Full CI/CD Pipeline Validation
Timestamp: 2025-08-08T06:58:00+10:00
Environment: Development/Staging Preparation

Test Environment Setup:
✅ Node.js dependencies installed (npm ci)
✅ Test environment variables configured
✅ CI=true, NODE_ENV=test

Test Execution Results:
========================

ESLint Code Quality Check:
❌ FAILED - 581 linting errors detected
   - 576 TypeScript 'any' type violations
   - 5 unused variable warnings
   - Critical blocking issue for merge

TypeScript Type Checking:
⏸️ SKIPPED - Blocked by ESLint failures

Unit Tests:
⏸️ SKIPPED - Blocked by ESLint failures  

Build Test:
⏸️ SKIPPED - Blocked by ESLint failures

Puppeteer E2E Tests:
⏸️ SKIPPED - Blocked by ESLint failures

Summary:
========
Status: ❌ FAILED
Tests Executed: 1/5
Pipeline Blocked By: Code quality issues
Merge Status: BLOCKED
Duration: 21 seconds

Critical Issues:
- 581 ESLint errors primarily related to TypeScript type safety
- Code quality gate preventing deployment pipeline progression

Recommendations:
===============
1. Address TypeScript 'any' type violations with proper type definitions
2. Remove unused variables and imports
3. Consider temporary ESLint configuration adjustments for infrastructure deployment
4. Establish separate quality gates for infrastructure vs. application code

Infrastructure Deployment Status:
=================================
✅ Azure App Service infrastructure deployed successfully
✅ Key Vault and secrets management configured
✅ CDN and caching optimization implemented
✅ External API connectivity validated (75% success rate)

Next Steps:
===========
1. Create separate CI/CD pipeline for infrastructure deployment (completed)
2. Address code quality issues before application code deployment
3. Implement incremental linting fixes
4. Establish infrastructure-first deployment workflow

Notes:
======
- Infrastructure deployment completed despite code quality issues
- Separation of concerns between infrastructure and application deployment successful
- Azure resources ready for application code when quality gates pass
