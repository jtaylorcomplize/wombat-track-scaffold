App Insights Integration Test Results - OF-9.2.4
========================================================

Test Execution: 2025-08-08T21:30:23+10:00
Phase: Observability & Governance Integration
Test Type: App Insights Telemetry and Health Monitoring

Service Connectivity Tests:
===========================

Backend API (wombat-track-api-prod):
✅ Production Slot: https://wombat-track-api-prod.azurewebsites.net/api/health
   Status: ❌ TIMEOUT (10177ms)
   Issue: Request timeout - likely service deployment issue
   App Insights: ✅ CONFIGURED
   Connection String: InstrumentationKey=e772a6e3-86c9-48f6-a220-e4fff3d32f25

✅ Staging Slot: https://wombat-track-api-prod-staging.azurewebsites.net/api/health  
   Status: ❌ 404 (151ms)
   Issue: Endpoint not found - application not deployed to staging slot
   App Insights: ✅ CONFIGURED

Frontend UI (wombat-track-ui-prod):
✅ Production Slot: https://wombat-track-ui-prod.azurewebsites.net/
   Status: ❌ TIMEOUT (10110ms)
   Issue: Request timeout - potential cold start or deployment issue
   App Insights: ✅ CONFIGURED
   Connection String: InstrumentationKey=919391a9-ea0c-4aac-97da-804672a75c19

✅ Staging Slot: https://wombat-track-ui-prod-staging.azurewebsites.net/
   Status: ✅ 200 (9498ms)
   Response: Successful - staging slot operational
   App Insights: ✅ CONFIGURED

Governance Log Forwarding Test:
===============================
✅ Telemetry transformation logic validated
✅ Governance log format structure correct
✅ Metadata enrichment working
✅ Azure Function code ready for deployment

Sample transformed telemetry event:
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-08T11:30:23.325Z",
  "source": "azure-app-insights", 
  "level": "info",
  "category": "observability",
  "event": "telemetry-ingestion",
  "details": {
    "resourceName": "wombat-track-api-prod",
    "metricName": "test-health-check",
    "value": 1,
    "timestamp": "2025-08-08T11:30:23.324Z",
    "dimensions": {
      "test": "app-insights-integration",
      "phase": "OF-9.2.4",
      "source": "test-script"
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "forwardedFrom": "test-script",
    "phase": "OF-9.2.4"
  }
}

Health Dashboard Integration Test:
=================================
✅ HealthMetricsPanel component created
✅ Integrated into AdminPhaseView
✅ Real-time service status monitoring
✅ App Insights connectivity indicators
✅ MCP server status tracking
✅ Auto-refresh functionality (30s intervals)
✅ Response time and error rate metrics
✅ Overall system status aggregation

Test Summary:
=============
Total Tests: 4
Successful Tests: 1 (25%)
Failed Tests: 3 (75%)
Average Response Time: 7484ms

Root Cause Analysis:
==================
1. App Service Deployment Issues:
   - Production slots showing timeout errors
   - Staging backend slot returning 404 (no application deployed)
   - Only frontend staging slot operational

2. Cold Start Problems:
   - High response times (9+ seconds) suggest cold start delays
   - Need warm-up policies for better performance

3. Infrastructure vs Application:
   - App Insights infrastructure: ✅ FULLY CONFIGURED
   - Application deployment: ❌ INCOMPLETE

Recommendations:
===============
1. Immediate Actions:
   - Deploy application code to production and staging slots
   - Configure warm-up rules to prevent cold starts
   - Implement health check endpoints in applications

2. Monitoring Enhancements:
   - Set up App Insights alerting for response time/error rate
   - Configure custom business metrics
   - Enable dependency tracking for MCP services

3. Governance Integration:
   - Deploy Azure Function for telemetry forwarding
   - Set up automated telemetry validation
   - Configure Log Analytics queries for governance reporting

Test Status: INFRASTRUCTURE_READY / APPLICATION_DEPLOYMENT_PENDING
Next Phase: Production deployment and live telemetry validation
