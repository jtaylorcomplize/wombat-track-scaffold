Summary: React.lazy OrbisRouter refactor step created for performance optimization and code splitting.

Step Details:
- Step ID: OF-8.4.1
- Phase ID: OF-8.4
- Step Name: React.lazy OrbisRouter refactor
- Status: Planned
- Progress: 0%
- Assigned To: Development Team
- Transaction ID: tx_1754360466742_c87m84not
- Governance Log ID: 194

Objective: Implement React.lazy for dynamic imports in OrbisRouter to improve initial bundle size and loading performance.

Technical Scope:
- Convert static imports to dynamic imports using React.lazy
- Implement Suspense boundaries for loading states
- Update router configuration for code splitting
- Ensure proper error boundaries for failed chunk loading
- Test performance improvements and bundle size reduction

Dependencies:
- Current OrbisRouter implementation
- React 18+ lazy loading capabilities
- Bundle analyzer reports for optimization metrics

Success Criteria:
- Reduced initial bundle size by 20%+
- Improved time-to-interactive metrics
- No regression in navigation performance
- Proper loading states for all route transitions
