==========================================
SUMMARY & RECOMMENDATIONS
==========================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
1. RENAME 30 "Unknown Phase" entries with descriptive names based on content
2. ARCHIVE completed design and post-mortem phases to historical records
3. RECLASSIFY active phases under proper project categories
4. UPDATE project references to use consistent naming convention
5. VALIDATE that all renamed phases maintain governance log linkages

BATCH OPERATIONS RECOMMENDED:
- Design Phases: Rename Orb-1.x series to "Orbis Brand Development Phase X"
- WT Infrastructure: Rename WT-3.x series to descriptive infrastructure names
- Strategic Planning: Rename WT-2.x series to strategic initiative names
- Data Management: Rename WP-1.x series to data processing phase names

GOVERNANCE IMPACT:
- All phases contain valuable historical context in notes field
- Governance log entries are properly linked via governance log IDs
- Memory anchors should be created for renamed phases
- Audit trail must be maintained during renaming process

PRIORITY CLASSIFICATION:
HIGH: Active and In Progress phases (8 phases)
MEDIUM: Completed strategic phases (12 phases)  
LOW: Historical and archive phases (10 phases)

ESTIMATED EFFORT:
- Batch rename operations: 2-3 hours
- Governance log validation: 1 hour
- Memory anchor generation: 1 hour
- Quality assurance review: 1 hour

NEXT STEPS:
1. Approve phase renaming strategy
2. Execute batch rename operations via API
3. Generate memory anchors for renamed phases
4. Validate governance log integrity
5. Update project documentation with new phase names
