Summary: Lint sweep & AutoAudit validation step created for automated code quality and security checks.

Step Details:
- Step ID: OF-8.4.2
- Phase ID: OF-8.4
- Step Name: Lint sweep & AutoAudit validation
- Status: Planned
- Progress: 0%
- Assigned To: System Automation
- Transaction ID: tx_1754360479862_w4bpwu4st
- Governance Log ID: 196

Objective: Comprehensive automated code quality validation and security audit sweep across the entire codebase.

Automation Scope:
- ESLint validation with strict configuration
- TypeScript compiler checks with --strict mode
- Prettier code formatting validation
- Security vulnerability scanning (npm audit, Snyk)
- Dead code elimination detection
- Bundle size analysis and optimization recommendations
- Dependency license compliance check
- Performance regression detection

Quality Gates:
- Zero ESLint errors (warnings acceptable with justification)
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- No high or critical security vulnerabilities
- Bundle size within established thresholds
- All dependencies have compatible licenses
- Performance benchmarks maintained or improved

Automated Tools:
- ESLint with custom configuration
- TypeScript compiler (tsc)
- Prettier formatter
- npm audit / yarn audit
- Webpack Bundle Analyzer
- License-checker
- Performance budget validation

Dependencies:
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Automated testing infrastructure
- Security scanning tools
- Performance monitoring baselines

Success Criteria:
- 100% automated checks passing
- Security scan reports clean
- Performance benchmarks within acceptable ranges
- Code quality metrics meeting or exceeding standards
- Automated report generation for governance logs

Memory Context: Automated validation step ensuring code quality and security compliance before project closure.
