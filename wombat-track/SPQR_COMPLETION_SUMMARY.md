## 📊 Technical Architecture

### **3-Level Model Implementation:**
```
Fields → Cards → Dashboards
```

1. **Fields**: 79 Actionstep fields defined with complete metadata
2. **Cards**: 21 validated dashboard cards with field mappings  
3. **Dashboards**: Organized into 4 business domains

### **Data Pipeline:**
```
Actionstep API → Field Dictionary → Card Specifications → Looker Studio
```

### **Governance & Validation:**
- TypeScript-based card generation with full validation
- MCP Issue Table integration for governance logging
- Field-level validation against business rules
- Automated consistency checking
