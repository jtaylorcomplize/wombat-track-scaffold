# Issue: Authority Delegation Protocol for Autonomous CC/Gizmo Operations

## Purpose
Allow Claude Code (CC) + Gizmo to operate autonomously in SDLC without manual terminal approvals, while maintaining full GovernanceLog and MemoryPlugin traceability.

## Problem Statement
Currently, CC operations require manual approval at each step, creating delays in:
- Branch creation and PRs
- Governance logging 
- Memory anchoring
- Import operations
- Agent activation

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: All autonomous actions maintain governance and memory logging
- **Safeguards**: Main branch merges still require QA & governance approval
- **Audit Trail**: Complete traceability through GovernanceLog + MemoryPlugin

## QA Plan
1. Verify autonomous actions logged to GovernanceLog + MemoryPlugin
2. Test branch creation, PR, import, and memory anchoring without prompts
3. Confirm main merge protection remains intact
4. Validate Activity Feed displays autonomous operations

## Implementation Scope
- Create `developer_authority.json` configuration
- Update CC/Gizmo runtime authority checking
- Implement autonomous action logging
- Add Activity Feed to Orbis Admin Dashboard

## Success Criteria
- CC operates without terminal approval prompts
- All actions produce governance & memory entries  
- SDLC hygiene maintained
- Complete audit visibility in Admin Dashboard
