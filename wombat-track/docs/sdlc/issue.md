# Gizmo SDLC Integration Issue

## Purpose of Gizmo Embedding
Integrate Gizmo agent into oApp to enforce SDLC governance and hygiene across the development lifecycle. This ensures that all branches maintain proper discipline with CI/CD checkpoints, manual QA validation, and Memory anchoring only after successful completion.

## Affected Modules

### Backend Integration
- **New**: `src/server/agents/gizmo.ts` - Core Gizmo agent implementation
- **New**: `src/server/api/sdlc/` - SDLC-specific API endpoints
  - `phase-steps.ts` - Phase step management and tracking
  - `governance-log.ts` - Enhanced governance logging for SDLC
  - `memory-anchor.ts` - Memory anchoring triggers post-QA
  - `ci-status.ts` - CI/CD status monitoring and enforcement
- **Modified**: `src/services/governance-logger.ts` - Extended for SDLC capture
- **Modified**: `src/server/api.ts` - Integration of new SDLC routes

### Frontend Integration
- **New**: `src/components/admin/SDLCDashboard.tsx` - SDLC oversight in Admin UI
- **Modified**: `src/pages/admin/` - Integration of SDLC Dashboard tab
- **Modified**: `src/components/layout/AdminAppLayout.tsx` - Navigation updates

### Services & Utilities
- **Modified**: `src/services/enhancedGovernanceLogger.ts` - SDLC event capture
- **New**: `src/services/sdlc-orchestrator.ts` - SDLC workflow management
- **Modified**: `src/utils/driveMemorySync.ts` - Memory anchoring integration

## SDLC Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Branch Discipline**: Automatic enforcement of feature branch creation from main
2. **Merge Blocking**: CI/CD and manual QA must pass before merge allowed
3. **Memory Anchoring**: Only trigger after successful QA to prevent pollution

### Medium Risk Areas
1. **Admin UI Integration**: New SDLC Dashboard must not conflict with existing admin functionality
2. **Governance Logging**: Enhanced logging must maintain backward compatibility
3. **Performance Impact**: Real-time SDLC monitoring should not degrade system performance

### Low Risk Areas
1. **Documentation**: SDLC process documentation and templates
2. **Testing**: Integration tests for SDLC workflows
3. **UI Styling**: SDLC Dashboard styling and user experience

## Manual QA Plan

### Pre-Implementation QA
- [ ] Verify all existing admin functionality remains intact
- [ ] Confirm governance logging continues to work as expected
- [ ] Test Memory Plugin anchoring in current state

### Implementation QA Checkpoints

#### Phase 1: Backend Implementation
- [ ] Gizmo agent can be instantiated and responds to events
- [ ] SDLC API endpoints return expected data structures
- [ ] Enhanced governance logger captures SDLC events correctly
- [ ] CI/CD status monitoring works with mock data

#### Phase 2: Frontend Integration
- [ ] SDLC Dashboard renders without errors in Admin UI
- [ ] Dashboard displays live debug/QA status from API
- [ ] Navigation between existing admin tabs remains functional
- [ ] SDLC Dashboard updates in real-time during workflow

#### Phase 3: Workflow Integration
- [ ] Branch creation automatically triggers PhaseStep(Debug)
- [ ] Build completion logs governance entry
- [ ] Merge attempts are blocked without proper QA evidence
- [ ] Memory anchoring only occurs after QA success

### Final Integration QA
- [ ] Complete SDLC workflow from branch creation to merge
- [ ] All admin functionality remains operational
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages SDLC failures
- [ ] Documentation reflects new SDLC process

## Success Criteria
1. **Branch Discipline**: 100% of feature branches created through SDLC process
2. **QA Enforcement**: 0% merges without proper QA evidence
3. **Memory Integrity**: Memory anchors only created post-successful QA
4. **Admin Integration**: SDLC Dashboard seamlessly integrated in admin UI
5. **Performance**: No degradation to existing system performance
6. **Documentation**: Complete SDLC process documented with examples

## Implementation Priority
- **P0 (Critical)**: Backend SDLC agent and API endpoints
- **P1 (High)**: Admin UI integration and dashboard
- **P2 (Medium)**: Enhanced governance logging and memory anchoring
- **P3 (Low)**: Integration tests and documentation

## Dependencies
- Existing governance logging system
- Current admin UI framework
- Memory Plugin architecture
- CI/CD pipeline integration points
