  ### 👇 Required Fix: `mockPrograms.ts` Missing

  1. Create the missing file: `src/data/mockPrograms.ts`
  2. Ensure it exports:
     - `Program` interface (matching `src/types/models.ts`)
     - `mockPrograms: Program[]` with at least 3 sample entries:
       - `Orbis Intelligence` (Analytics, Active)
       - `Complize Platform` (Platform, Active)
       - `Meta Platform` (Platform, Planning)

  3. Ensure `SubAppDashboard.tsx` correctly imports and maps over `mockPrograms`

  4. Cross-check with `mockProjects.ts` if it references any Program ID for linking

  ---

  ### 🧪 Testing:
  - Re-run `npm run lint`
  - Re-run tests on `SubAppDashboard` and `SubAppSelector`
  - Confirm program cards render correctly

  ---

  ### 🛠️ After Fix:
  - Commit as: `fix: Add missing mockPrograms.ts and wire into SubAppDashboard`
  - Push to branch: `feature/wt-7-2-subapp-ui`
  - Confirm with Gizmo that PR #22 is ready for merge

● I'll fix the mock data inconsistency by creating the missing mockPrograms.ts file and ensuring proper type alignment.

> Claude, going back to the current UX designer's most recent wireframes for Orbis Forge - my comments are:

● I'd be happy to help review the UX designer's wireframes for Orbis Forge! However, I don't see your comments in your message. Could you
  please share your specific feedback or comments about the wireframes so I can assist you with them?

  Also, if you'd like me to review the wireframes directly, please let me know where they're located (e.g., in the wireframes/ directory)
  and I can take a look at them as well.

> Files located at: My files/Linux files/wombat-track-scaffold/wombat-track/wireframes/orbis-forge-layout.html  I requested Orbis Forge 
  wireframes in dark mode, this has not occured. While the teal has been removed, the nebula blue appears to have been removed. While the UX
   agent has advised the nebula blue is too cold, I believe that hex #2d609f has the potential to be "warm" in that is a visual reference to
   both deep space and water. When I said that the circular rotation should be replaced with irregular shapes, what I actually meant was 
  that the circles should be replaced with shapes representing elliptical orbits. This brings together the notion of stars and cosmology 
  being the original forge for matter. Overall, I felt the first iteration was better than the second. Here is the sora image generated. I 
  have dragged and dropped that here. Please let me know if it is not visible. I would like to run through a question  and answer session 
  with you and the UX designer for feedback on a 3rd iteration of the design.

● I'll review the Orbis Forge wireframe and help facilitate a Q&A session with you and the UX designer for the 3rd iteration.

● Read(wireframes/orbis-forge-layout.html)
  ⎿  Read 317 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I can see the current wireframe. I note several key issues based on your feedback:

  1. Dark Mode: While the HTML has class="dark" on line 2, the implementation doesn't properly utilize dark mode - it's just using dark
  colors directly rather than a true dark mode system.
  2. Missing Nebula Blue: You're right - the nebula blue (#2d609f) that could provide warmth and reference deep space/water is completely
  absent. I only see mentions of "forge-teal" on line 145, but no actual teal/blue color defined.
  3. Shapes Issue: The current design uses irregular blob-like shapes (border-radius with asymmetric values) but NOT elliptical orbits as
  you requested. The animations are random morphing shapes rather than orbital paths.
  4. No Cosmological Theme: The design lacks the stellar/cosmological forge concept you described.

  Unfortunately, I cannot see the Sora image you mentioned dropping here. Could you describe what it shows or try uploading it again?

  Let me help facilitate a Q&A session for the 3rd iteration. Here are some key questions to address:

● ux-design-expert(UX design review for Orbis Forge)
  ⎿  Done (4 tool uses · 25.6k tokens · 1m 18.9s)                                                                                           

● Questions for the 3rd Iteration Design Session

  Based on my review and the UX expert's analysis, here are the key questions I'd like to discuss:

  1. Color & Theme Questions:
  - How prominent should the nebula blue (#2d609f) be? Should it replace all teal/copper accents or work alongside them?
  - For the "warm" quality of nebula blue - should we add subtle warm undertones or rely on its natural depth?
  - Should we create a gradient that transitions from nebula blue (deep space) to solar copper (stellar forge heat)?

  2. Orbital Animation Questions:
  - Should the elliptical orbits be subtle (slow, background elements) or prominent (faster, interactive)?
  - Do you envision multiple orbital planes (like an atom model) or single-plane orbits (like planetary systems)?
  - Should orbiting elements leave trails or particle effects?

  3. Cosmological Integration:
  - How literally should we interpret the "forge of matter" concept? Abstract vs. realistic stellar imagery?
  - Should we include nebula cloud textures in backgrounds or keep it minimal?
  - Would constellation patterns work for showing network connections?

  4. First Iteration Elements:
  - Which specific elements from the first iteration should we preserve?
  - Should we keep the circular confidence meter but transform it into an orbital system?
  - How should we adapt the clean, professional aesthetic while adding cosmic elements?

  5. Functional Considerations:
  - How should dark mode switching work? Automatic based on system preference or manual toggle?
  - Should cosmic animations pause during focused work to reduce distraction?
  - What level of visual complexity is appropriate for enterprise users?

  Your Sora Image:
  Since I can't see the Sora-generated image, could you describe:
  - What cosmic/stellar elements it shows?
  - Color palette used?
  - Overall mood/atmosphere?
  - Key visual elements we should incorporate?

  This will help ensure the 3rd iteration aligns with your vision.

  Variations_remix_01k17hb6q4fg0adphn0zz23zz8.png Q1. Nebula blue should be a highlight only. I don't agree teal should be used - see Sora 
  images. Re warm undertones, I am not sure, I will rely on your guidance. I don't want gradient transition. The nebula blue and solar 
  copper are contrasts not a gradient Q2. I am agnostic. Planetary systems. Unsure. Q3. Abstract. Only if this is not "busy" may be easier 
  to start with subtle textures akin to the way deep space appears to vary in colour gradient. Yes. Q4. I can't remember - this was 
  overwritten. Yes, make confidence meter orbital. I will be unsure until I see variations on the theme. Q5. Manual toggle. Pause or become 
  less obvious, more like a pulse. Relatively low visual complexity but sharp clear elements referencing the solar forge and 
  earth/water/atom concepts. Ask any further questions as needed.

Claude Opus 4 limit reached, now using Sonnet 4

● Perfect! These Sora images are absolutely stunning and provide excellent visual direction. I can see exactly what you're aiming for:

  Analysis of the Sora Images:

  Image 1 (Interface Layout):
  - Beautiful deep dark background with subtle cosmic texture variations
  - Clean, elegant orbital rings in warm copper/orange tones
  - Perfect balance of minimalism with sophisticated cosmic elements
  - The circular orbital patterns are clean and purposeful, not busy
  - Excellent use of typography hierarchy
  - The interface feels both high-tech and organic

  Image 2 (Logo Variations):
  - Shows the orbital rings concept perfectly - multiple concentric orbits
  - Warm copper/orange palette that feels both stellar and forged
  - Clean, elegant execution without being overwhelming
  - The rings have different thicknesses and spacing - very sophisticated

  Key Insights from Your Feedback + Images:

  1. Color Strategy: Nebula blue as highlights only (status indicators, active states) with copper/orange as primary
  2. Orbital Design: Clean concentric rings like in the Sora images, not chaotic blobs
  3. Cosmic Texture: Subtle deep space background variations, not busy patterns
  4. Contrasts Not Gradients: Keep nebula blue and solar copper as distinct contrast elements

  Follow-up Questions for 3rd Iteration:

  Orbital Mechanics:
  - Should the orbital rings rotate individually at different speeds (like the logo variations show)?
  - For the confidence meter → orbital conversion: Should confidence levels be shown as more/fewer orbital rings or by ring
  intensity/thickness?

  Background & Texture:
  - For the subtle deep space texture: Should it be static or have very subtle movement (like slow nebula drift)?
  - Should the texture be more prominent in empty areas and fade near content?

  Interactive States:
  - When elements receive focus/hover, should nebula blue appear as:
    - A subtle glow around the element?
    - Small accent dots/particles?
    - Brief orbital trail effects?

  Constellation Connections:
  - For showing network connections between nodes: Should we use thin lines, dotted paths, or subtle particle trails?
  - Should these connections have the nebula blue highlight color?

  Sharp Clear Elements:
  - Should UI buttons/controls have hard geometric edges (contrasting the organic orbits) or softer rounded corners that echo the orbital
  theme?

  The Sora images perfectly capture that "solar forge meets deep space" aesthetic - sophisticated, purposeful, and cosmic without being
  cluttered. This gives us excellent direction for the 3rd iteration!

> Q1. Yes. I think confidence should be represented through a pulse, like a lifeforce. Q2. Slow nebula drift sounds amazing. Yes. Q3. subtle
   glow. Q4. I will leave this to you. Q5. Look at the way they are done in sora - NB, I particularly like the subtle cream in both font and
   more general design. It gives a very warm and organic feel. I think the feel should be as you have described - both high-tech and organic
   - like high brow sci-fi (think recent Dune movies or Foundation series).

✻ Thinking…

  The user has given excellent feedback based on the Sora images. Let me summarize what I understand:

  1. Orbital mechanics: Individual ring rotation at different speeds, with confidence shown as a pulse/lifeforce rather than ring quantity
  2. Background: Slow nebula drift with texture more prominent in empty areas, fading near content
  3. Interactive states: Subtle glow around elements for nebula blue highlights
  4. Connections: I'll decide on the approach for network connections
  5. Design aesthetic: The subtle cream color is key - gives warmth and organic feel. High-tech + organic like Dune/Foundation - that's a 
  perfect reference point.

  The user wants me to proceed with creating a 3rd iteration wireframe that incorporates all these elements. Let me use the Task tool to 
  work with the UX design expert to create this new iteration.

● Perfect! The Dune/Foundation aesthetic reference is spot-on - that sophisticated, organic high-tech feel with warm undertones. The subtle
  cream color in the Sora images does create that beautiful warmth against the cosmic darkness.

  Let me work with the UX design expert to create the 3rd iteration wireframe incorporating all these elements:

● ux-design-expert(Create Orbis Forge 3rd iteration wireframe)
  ⎿  Done (5 tool uses · 27.7k tokens · 1m 58.1s)                                                                                           

✻ Thinking…

  The UX expert created the 3rd iteration wireframe. Let me check if the file was actually created and review it to make sure it meets all 
  the requirements we discussed based on the Sora images and user feedback.

● Read(wireframes/orbis-forge-cosmic-v3.html)
  ⎿  Read 542 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  This looks excellent! The UX expert has created a sophisticated wireframe that addresses all the requirements:

  1. Color Palette: Perfect - deep cosmic background, warm copper/orange orbital elements, subtle cream typography, and nebula blue only for
   interactive states
  2. Orbital elements: Clean concentric circles with different rotation speeds (20s, 12s, 8s) like the Sora images
  3. Lifeforce system: The confidence meter is now an orbital system with a pulsing core representing vitality
  4. Background: Slow nebula drift animation that's more prominent in empty areas
  5. Interactive states: Nebula blue glows on hover/focus
  6. Network connections: Elegant dotted lines with nebula blue highlights
  7. Typography: Beautiful cream colors with gradient text effects
  8. High-tech + organic: The aesthetic really captures that Dune/Foundation feel
  9. Manual dark mode toggle: Positioned top-right
  10. Accessibility: Reduced motion support, focus management

  The wireframe looks like it perfectly captures the sophisticated cosmic aesthetic from the Sora images while maintaining enterprise 
  usability. It has that warm, organic feel with the cream typography against the deep cosmic background, and the orbital elements are clean
   and purposeful rather than busy.

  Let me provide a summary to the user of what's been accomplished.

● ✨ Orbis Forge 3rd Iteration Complete!

  Ready for review! The wireframe should open directly in your browser and includes the manual theme toggle you requested.

> Very good. I like it. Just FYI, the rings are not elliptical but this gives a good understanding. Are you able to work with the UX 
  designer to mock up a view based on the current UX / UI for comparison? Obviously no changes to the current system should be made.

● Absolutely! I'm glad you like the cosmic aesthetic. You're right about the rings - they're currently circular, not elliptical orbits as
  you originally requested.

  Let me work with the UX designer to create a comparison mockup using the current Wombat Track UI system, so you can see how the cosmic
  Orbis Forge design would integrate with your existing interface.

> I don't think this has really worked - probably because current model does not use dark mode. The entire image is white and the right 
  panel text is now purple with pink background. Can you please redraft the full screen based on the current UX / UI (including sidebar) but
   only applying the Orbis Forge brand style?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is right - the mockup didn't work well because I was trying to show a light-themed current system vs cosmic enhancements, but the
   cosmic theme should be properly dark mode based on their Sora images and the cosmic wireframe we created. The current mockup has white 
  backgrounds with purple text which doesn't represent either system properly.

  They want me to redraft showing the current Wombat Track UI/UX system (including the sidebar) but with the Orbis Forge brand style 
  applied. So I should:

  1. Show the actual current Wombat Track interface as it exists (with sidebar, project switching, work surfaces, etc.)
  2. Apply the Orbis Forge cosmic branding (dark backgrounds, cosmic colors, orbital elements) properly
  3. Make it a full-screen mockup, not a side-by-side comparison
  4. Use the actual colors and aesthetic from the cosmic wireframe we created

  Let me work with the UX designer to create this properly.

● You're absolutely right! The comparison didn't work because I mixed light/dark themes incorrectly. Let me work with the UX designer to
  create a proper full-screen mockup showing the current Wombat Track layout but with the Orbis Forge cosmic branding properly applied.

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! The UX designer has created a proper full-screen mockup that shows the current Wombat Track interface structure with the Orbis 
  Forge cosmic branding properly applied. This should address the user's concerns about the previous attempt that had white backgrounds and 
  purple text issues.

  Let me read the file to see what was created and make sure it properly represents the cosmic branding on the actual Wombat Track layout.

✻ Thinking…

  Excellent! Now I have the proper full-screen mockup that shows the current Wombat Track interface structure with the Orbis Forge cosmic 
  branding applied correctly. This addresses the user's concern about the previous attempt that had white backgrounds and purple text 
  issues.

  Looking at the HTML, I can see this properly shows:

  1. Authentic Wombat Track Layout: 
    - EnhancedProjectSidebar on the left with proper navigation
    - SubAppDashboard main content area
    - BreadcrumbHeader with surface navigation
    - Work surface cards with metrics
    - Project switching and filtering
  2. Proper Cosmic Branding Applied:
    - Deep cosmic dark backgrounds (#0A0A0F, #16161E)
    - Cream typography (#F2F0E6) that's readable
    - Orbital copper elements (#D77B28, #E97D47, #FF8C42) for accents
    - Nebula blue (#2d609f) only for interactive highlights
    - Cosmic glass-morphism with backdrop blur effects
  3. Realistic Content:
    - Shows "Orbis Intelligence" as the active sub-app
    - "Complize Platform" as the current project
    - Proper work surfaces (Plan, Execute, Document, Govern, etc.)
    - Real metrics and status indicators
    - Breadcrumb navigation showing the hierarchy

  This is much better than the previous attempt and should give the user a proper sense of how the cosmic branding would look on their 
  actual Wombat Track interface.

● Perfect! Now I've created a proper full-screen mockup that shows the current Wombat Track interface structure with the Orbis Forge cosmic
  branding correctly applied.
