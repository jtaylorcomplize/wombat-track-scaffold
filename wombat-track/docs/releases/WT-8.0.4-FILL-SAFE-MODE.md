## 🎯 Recommendations for Final Phase

### **WT-8.0.4.5 - Final Sync Pass**
Given the excellent data quality state revealed by safe-mode execution:

1. **Skip Bulk Operations**: No mass data updates needed
2. **Focus on Edge Cases**: Address any remaining manual review items
3. **Validation Only**: Run final integrity checks
4. **Production Switch**: Ready for oApp backend integration

### **Manual Review Items (If Any)**
- Legacy phase classifications (completed in previous phases)
- PR tag validations (validated through safe-mode scanning)
- Memory anchor associations (integrity confirmed)
