# GPT & AI Usage Policy - Wombat Track

## Purpose
This policy defines responsible AI usage guidelines for Wombat Track's recursive development workflows, ensuring ethical AI integration while maintaining code quality and governance compliance.

## Usage Guidelines

### Permitted AI Usage
- **Claude Code Integration**: Primary AI development partner for code generation, debugging, and documentation
- **Recursive Development**: AI-assisted feature development using established patterns and templates
- **Documentation Generation**: Automated creation of technical documentation and governance logs
- **Code Review Assistance**: AI-powered analysis for quality assurance and best practice compliance
- **Memory Anchor Classification**: Automated tagging and organization of project artifacts

### Required Governance Controls
- **Human Oversight**: All AI-generated code must be reviewed by human developers
- **Governance Logging**: AI actions must be recorded in GovernanceLog with audit trails
- **Memory Plugin Integration**: AI decisions tracked through MemoryPlugin anchor system
- **Quality Gates**: AI-generated content must pass lint, typecheck, and test validations

### Prohibited AI Usage
- **Autonomous Production Deployment**: AI cannot directly deploy to production without human approval
- **Security Policy Changes**: AI cannot modify security configurations or access controls
- **Financial Operations**: AI cannot initiate billing, purchasing, or financial transactions
- **External API Keys**: AI cannot generate, modify, or share authentication credentials

## Usage Patterns

### Code Generation Workflow
1. **Pattern Recognition**: AI identifies existing code patterns and conventions
2. **Template Application**: AI applies established templates and scaffolding
3. **Quality Validation**: Generated code passes automated quality checks
4. **Human Review**: Developer reviews and approves AI-generated implementation
5. **Governance Logging**: Action recorded with MemoryPlugin anchor for audit trail

### Documentation Workflow
1. **Context Analysis**: AI analyzes codebase and existing documentation patterns
2. **Content Generation**: AI creates structured documentation following established formats
3. **Memory Anchor Assignment**: Documentation tagged with relevant MemoryPlugin anchors
4. **Review and Approval**: Technical writing standards applied through human oversight
