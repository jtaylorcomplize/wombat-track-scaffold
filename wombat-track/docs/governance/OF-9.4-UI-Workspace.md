### Real-time Data Flow
1. **DriveMemoryWatcher** detects file system changes
2. **AutoGovernanceLogger** creates governance log entries
3. **WebSocket/SSE** pushes updates to UI clients
4. **GovernanceLogsUIService** receives and processes updates
5. **UI Components** automatically refresh with new data
6. **Local Cache** maintains performance during disconnections

- `PUT /api/admin/governance_logs/:id` - Update log
- `DELETE /api/admin/governance_logs/:id` - Delete log
- `POST /api/admin/governance_logs/:id/ai-summary` - Generate AI summary

#### WebSocket Events
- `connected` - Connection established
- `disconnected` - Connection lost
- `logUpdate` - Log created/updated/deleted
- `driveMemoryUpdate` - Drive memory file change
