# WT Database Audit - Executive Summary & Strategic Recommendations

**Generated:** 2025-07-30  
**Auditor:** Claude Code  
**Scope:** 92 Projects, 257 Phases, 45 Governance Entries

## 🎯 Executive Summary

### Critical Findings
The WT database audit reveals a **severe data quality and structural integrity crisis** that requires immediate attention:

- **Only 1 project (1.1%) qualifies as canonical** with a score ≥60
- **63 projects (68.5%) are archive candidates** with scores <20
- **81 projects (88%) have no defined phases** - lacking execution structure
- **31 orphaned phases** exist without valid project references
- **No potential duplicates found** - data is too fragmented for meaningful overlap detection

## 🏆 Top Canonical Project (Score ≥60)

### Rank #1: WT-UX14 - Integrate Surface (Score: 63)
- **Status:** Completed
- **Strengths:** Has 4 defined phases, good data quality (92%), completed status
- **Issues:** No owner assigned, no governance logs
- **Recommendation:** **Primary canonical candidate** - assign owner and establish governance

## 📋 Recommended Canonical Set (Top 20-30 Projects)

Based on the scoring analysis, here are the **29 highest-scoring projects** that should form the canonical development set:

### Tier 1: Primary Candidates (Score 50-63)
1. **WT-UX14** - Integrate Surface (63) - *Primary canonical project*
2. **WT-UX9** - Docs Module (58) - *Planning phase, has structure*
3. **WT-UX1** - WT MemSync Implementation (55) - *Active, 16 phases*
4. **WT-UX6** - WT SDLC Framework (54) - *Completed, needs owner*

### Tier 2: Secondary Candidates (Score 40-49)
5. **WT-UX15** - WT Project Overview (42) - *5 phases, governance potential*
6. **WT-UX8** - Core Feature Retrofit (41) - *8 phases, planning stage*
7. **WT-UX12** - Design Principles (41) - *4 phases, completed*

### Tier 3: Development Candidates (Score 25-39)
8. **WT-UX3** - WT PDLC + SDLC (29) - *Completed, needs phase structure*
9. **WT-UX13** - AI Integration – NotionGPT Connection (25)
10. **WT-UX11** - Post-mortem - sidebar rendering failure (25)
11. **WT-UX4** - WT SubApp Development (25)
12. **WT-UX10** - CI/CD Implementation (21)
13. **WT-UX5** - WT AI Collaboration (21)
14. **WT-UX7** - Agent Mesh Visualisation (20)
15. **WT-UX2** - WT Phase Object refactor (20)

### Tier 4: Potential Candidates (Score 20-24)
16-29. Additional RECON and infrastructure projects requiring evaluation

## 🗑️ Archive Candidates (63 Projects)

The majority of projects (68.5%) scored below 20 and should be considered for archival:

### Archive Categories:
1. **RECON-* Projects (55 projects)** - Legacy identifiers, fragmented data
2. **Fragment Projects (8 projects)** - Incomplete or broken project entries
3. **Orphaned Content** - Data without proper project structure

### Archive Criteria Met:
- No defined phases (execution structure missing)
- No assigned owners (accountability unclear)
- Poor data quality (malformed or incomplete)
- No governance logging (audit trail missing)
- Legacy RECON identifiers (migration artifacts)

## 🔧 Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

### 1. Data Structure Collapse
- **88% of projects lack phases** - fundamental execution structure missing
- **97% lack owners** - no accountability framework
- **31 orphaned phases** - broken referential integrity
- **Governance logs disconnected** from project structure

### 2. Legacy Migration Problems
- **RECON-* project IDs** indicate incomplete migration from legacy system
- **Fragmented project names** - parsing errors in data migration
- **Broken CSV structure** - projects split across multiple rows

### 3. Audit Trail Gaps
- **45 governance entries** for 92 projects = poor traceability
- **No governance-to-project linking** - audit trail broken
- **Missing RAG status** on 90% of phases

## ✅ Strategic Recommendations

### Phase 1: Emergency Data Stabilization (Immediate - Week 1)
1. **Stabilize Top 15 Projects**
   - Assign owners to WT-UX* projects
   - Create basic phase structure for phase-less canonical candidates
   - Establish governance logging for top performers

2. **Archive Legacy RECON Projects**
   - Move all RECON-* projects to archive database
   - Preserve for historical reference but remove from active development
   - Focus resources on WT-* canonical projects

3. **Fix Orphaned Records**
   - Link orphaned phases to correct projects where possible
   - Archive unresolvable orphans
   - Establish referential integrity constraints

### Phase 2: Canonical Set Development (Week 2-4)
1. **Establish 20-30 Canonical Projects**
   - Focus development on Tier 1-3 projects (scores 25+)
   - Assign dedicated owners to each canonical project
   - Create comprehensive phase plans for all canonical projects

2. **Implement Governance Framework**
   - Create governance log entries for all canonical projects
   - Establish RAG status tracking
   - Link audit trails to project execution

3. **Data Quality Standards**
   - Standardize all project IDs to WT-* format
   - Complete missing metadata fields
   - Implement data validation rules

### Phase 3: Operational Excellence (Month 2)
1. **Process Automation**
   - Automated governance logging
   - RAG status monitoring
   - Project health dashboards

2. **Expansion Planning**
   - Evaluate archive for recoverable projects
   - Plan new project creation standards
   - Establish canonical project graduation criteria

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Immediate Targets (30 days)
- [ ] **15 canonical projects** with owners assigned
- [ ] **0 orphaned records** - all resolved or archived
- [ ] **100% governance coverage** for canonical projects
- [ ] **50+ RECON projects archived** - active dataset cleaned

### Strategic Targets (90 days)
- [ ] **25-30 canonical projects** in active development
- [ ] **>80 completeness scores** for top 10 projects
- [ ] **100% phase coverage** for canonical projects
- [ ] **Real-time RAG monitoring** operational

## 🚨 Risk Assessment

### High Risk - Data Loss
- **Current data fragmentation** could lead to permanent loss of project history
- **No backup verification** of cleaned vs original data
- **Manual archive process** risks accidentally removing valuable projects

### Medium Risk - Development Disruption  
- **Resource reallocation** from low-value to canonical projects may disrupt ongoing work
- **Team resistance** to abandoning familiar RECON projects
- **Integration challenges** between cleaned canonical set and existing systems

### Low Risk - Operational Impact
- **Learning curve** for new data structure and governance processes
- **Timeline pressure** to achieve rapid improvement in completeness scores

## 🎯 Final Recommendation

**Implement a "Canonical Core Strategy":**

1. **Immediately focus on the top 15 projects** (WT-UX14, WT-UX9, WT-UX1, etc.)
2. **Archive 60+ low-value projects** to reduce maintenance overhead
3. **Establish robust governance** for the canonical set
4. **Build from strength** - use the 1 high-performing project as a template for others

This approach will transform the WT database from a **fragmented collection of legacy data** into a **focused, well-governed platform** ready for intensive development and AI-enhanced project management.
